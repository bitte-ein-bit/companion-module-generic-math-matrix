This module is a bit based scene selector build for the generic artnet module.

Syntax for a scene is `<startchannel:>value1 value2 value3 startchannel2:value4 value5 value6`
e.g. 1:255 32 23 34 45:44 3 4

This would set channel 1 to 255, channel 2 to 32, channel 3 to 23, channel 4 to 34, channel 45 to 44, channel 46 to 3 and channel 47 to 4.
